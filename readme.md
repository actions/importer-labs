# Welcome to Valet labs!
These Valet labs let you test-drive Valet by bootstrapping the environment of your choosing. The steps to get started with the Valet labs are:
1. Create your own GitHub Repository. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) below.
2. Bootstrap your environment. The default page of the lab of your choosing will detail how to configure and run the action to bootstrap the environment. Currently these labs support [Azure DevOps](azure_devops).
3. Run Valet via Codespaces. The codespace has docker running and will update to the latest Valet environment.
4. Proceed with running the labs!
